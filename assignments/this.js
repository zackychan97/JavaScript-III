/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global Binding - the default binding where THIS is the global context whenever the function is invoked w/o any other rules/principals

* 2. Implicit Binding - this binding occurs when dot notation (a period .) is used when we are invoking our function. Anything to the left side of our . is what our THIS is in the function

* 3. New Binding - this binding occurs when we use a constructor function, and a constructor function is a function that returns an object, so it is creating an object. We can create our variables that have this. to the left of them,  and assign them (=) values. Example would be this.greeting = 'Hello'; 

* 4. Explicit Binding - .call() .apply() and .bind() all allow us to point more objects to the THIS keyword. This binding occurs when we apply any of these methods (call, apply, bind) on a function. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
